        <p>This recipe is so good, I have modified it over the years to get even better results. After working with some Michelin starred chefs to<br>
        refine this recipe I think you will really enjoy it. It does take some time but the effort is worth it!</p>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>First we need to bring a large pot of water to a boil and cook the lasanga sheets, I generally add 2 tablespoons<br>
            of salt for every four quarts of water. You will need about 8 quarts of water to make this an easy cook. <br>
            While the water is coming to a boil you can dice your onions, carrots, and herbs. If your feeling abitious you<br>
            you can sautee or brown the meat including sausage. Once that is done remove the meat from the pan.</li>
            
            <li>Next you can sautee the onions and carrots in olive oil and use the same pan you cooked the meat in <br>
            do this until lightly translucent then add the wine for a second and then you scrap the bottom to get all<br>
            the good stuff off the bottom of the pan. Now you can add the meat mix back into the pan with the tomato<br>
            sauce with all the herbs and garlic. Salt to taste at the very end, not before.<br></li>

            <li>Now once the pasta is done and the sauce is going you can grate your cheese and begin lining your<br>
            baking dish, first I spread a little oil on the sides and bottom of the dish, then lay a sheet down.<br>
            Next i start to layer my ingredients. I go pasta, sauce, spinach, cheese, a little bit of sauce then<br>
            pasta again and repeat. Top layer should be pasta with a little bit sauce and cheese, this gives it a<br>
            good crispy layer and helps to hold everything together.</li>

            <li>Let it cool for fifteen to thirty minutes so it gels together better before cutting and serving. <br>
            This dish can be portioned and frozen to enjoy for later as well. You can also substitute dried pasta<br>
            sheets for freshly made ones just reduce the cooking time to 2 minutes maximum. Dried sheets take anywhere<br>
            between 8 to 10 minutes to cook.</li>
        </ol>
